# Vespers

(Project is still a WIP!)

Vespers aims to help out in situations where mass social media is inaccessible due to ISP/government firewalls by helping you broadcast media (currently an image) onto twitter account/s tied to whoever's deployed this project. 

## How it works

Upload image (react client) -> generate IPFS hash -> eth smart contract stores hash -> Twitter bot.

We assume that communication is possible w/ the IPFS node/s. That end of things is highly customizable however, and we want to offer maximum customizability so you can get your media out regardless of how strict the censorship is.

## Todo

This project is still a WIP and needs a bunch of work. Only making this public to get an idea from people if it's worth pursuing. As a result, lots to do.

- Twitter tx scan bot
- testing
- adding more info into smart contract?
- support text input
- donations for fee support
